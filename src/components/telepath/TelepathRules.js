            <p>This game tests your mental connection with a partner! <br/> Given a prompt, write related words to try to match the words of your partner. A word limit will be given next to the prompt. Compete against other teams to see which team is the most telepathic. <br/> If you don't want to play with teams, you can instead play the free-for-all mode. In this mode, you get points based on how many other people choose the same word as you.</p>
